# Time

	1. Assignment 01:	Predicted:	10h	||	Actual:	10h		# Almost perfectly fit to the expected time. However, I failed few tests and fixed after due date
	2. Assignment 02:	Predicted:	10h	||	Actual:	09h		# Finished about hour earlier. However not far away from the expected time. 
	3. Assignment 03:	Predicted:	12h	||	Actual:	12h		# I was getting bad grades from 1 and 2, so I decided to spend more time to test the class. 
	4. Assignment 04:	Predicted:	10h	||	Actual: 11h		# Spent more time to test the class.
